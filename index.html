<h2> Abstract </h2>

<blockquote>
Creative live streams, where artists or designers demonstrate their creative process, have emerged as a uniqueand popular genre of live streams due to the real-time interactivity they afford.
However, streamer-viewerinteractions on most live streaming platforms only enable users to utilize text and emojis to communicate,which limits what viewers can convey and share in real time.
To investigate the design space of potential visualand non-textual modalities within creative live streams, we first analyzed existing Twitch extensions andconducted a formative study with streamers who share creative activities to uncover key challenges that thesestreamers face.
We then designed and implemented a prototype system, StreamSketch, which enables viewers and streamers to interact during live streams using multiple modalities, including freeform sketches and text.
The prototype was evaluated by two professional artist streamers and their viewers during six streamingsessions.
Overall, streamers and viewers found that StreamSketch provided increased engagement and newaffordances compared to the traditional text-only modality, and highlighted how efficiency, moderation, andtool integration were continued challenges.
